# xc3_model
xc3_model is a high level library for [xc3_lib](https://crates.io/crates/xc3_lib).

xc3_model provides a simple, standardized interface for working with models, textures, materials, and animations. All models and maps from all supported game versions are converted to the same set of types. This greatly reduces the amount of code needed for applications and libraries to work with in game models.

xc3_model currently lacks write support, so edits to files should use xc3_lib. Python bindings for xc3_model are available with [xc3_model_py](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/xc3_model_py).
