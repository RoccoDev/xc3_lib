# Contributing
Thank you for expressing interest in improving xc3_lib! This document outlines some basic guidelines for how to effectively contribute to this repository.

## Getting Started
The xc3_lib repository contains a number of different projects. See [architecture](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/xc3_lib/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md) for an overview and design goals of each of the projects. See [development](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/xc3_lib/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md) for getting started with tasks like installing Rust, dumping game files, or debugging tools and techniques.

## Issues
Issues are a way to request features or report bugs. Even if you have no coding experience, reporting issues is still a valuable way to contribute to development by identifying potential problems and suggesting new features and improvements. 

Bug reports should state what's happening, explain why you think the behavior is unexpected, and provide additional context like the game or version of the xc3_lib tools you are using. For errors on unmodified game files, please provide the path of the file you're working with instead of just the name like "chr/ch/ch01011013.wimdo" instead of "Noah's jacket" to avoid any ambiguity.

Features suggestions should describe the feature, explain why it's relevant, and provide additional information like images or links to similar features in other programs.

## Pull Requests
If you plan on making a PR, please make an issue first if there isn't one already. Indicate on the issue that you plan on working on implementing the necessary changes. I'll get back to you when I'm available to give feedback. It's important to make an issue first so I can help outline the needed changes as well as the affected projects. It's also possible that someone is already working on implementing it.

Pull requests should generally be small to make them easier to review. PRs that affect many files will still be reviewed, but the process will take longer. It's ok if the code has a few bugs. Please say if there's anything you may be stuck on. This provides an opportunity for myself and others to brainstorm solutions.
